Miniconda3-latest-Windows-x86_64.exe /NoRegistry=1 /S /D=c:\installed

Once install has finished (miniconda executable keeps running even after it's done?), delete the subfolders under pkgs. They will be recreated on demand and this greatly reduces number of files / amount of space used.

Create a condarc file in c:\installed:

# directories in which environments are located
envs_dirs:
  - ~/.conda/envs

Delete the contents of Miniconda3-x64, and replace with the contents of c:\installed
