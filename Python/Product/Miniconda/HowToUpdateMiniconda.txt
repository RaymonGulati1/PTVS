Miniconda3-latest-Windows-x86_64.exe /NoRegistry=1 /S /D=c:\installed

Once install has finished (miniconda executable keeps running even after it's done?), delete the contents of the pkgs folder, but keep the empty folder with a placeholder.txt that ensures the folder gets created. As the user install conda packages, they will get cached in the user's local app data folder.

Create a condarc file in c:\installed:

# directories in which environments are located
envs_dirs:
  - ~/.conda/envs

Delete the contents of Miniconda3-x64, and replace with the contents of c:\installed
